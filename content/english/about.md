I currently work as a Quantitative Analyst for Flutter UKI, using mathematical and statistical modelling, machine learning and software development to make predictions in sport.

Prior to working for Flutter I was hired as a postdoctoral researcher in machine learning, researching fog forecasting using machine learning techniques at Met Ã‰ireann, before getting promoted to Machine Learning Meteorologist. I have a PhD in Applied Mathematical Modelling from the University of Limerick, Ireland.

Previously, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher in applied and industrial mathematics, working on modelling anodes in lithium ion batteries as part of the Si-Drive international consortium.

I have proven expertise in scientific computation, mathematical modelling, numerical analysis and data visualisation.

My hobbies and interests include downhill skiing, football and GAA.
