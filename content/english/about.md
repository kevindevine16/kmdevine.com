I am a postdoctoral researcher in applied and industrial mathematics, currently researching the modelling of anodes in lithium ion batteries as part of the Si-Drive international consortium. I have a PhD in Applied Mathematical Modelling from the University of Limerick, Ireland. I have proven expertise in scientific computation, mathematical modelling, numerical analysis and data visualisation. I am now seeking to apply this experience to a role in an industrial setting and am currently exploring employment opportunites in data science, analytics, mathematical modelling and numerical analysis.
