In October 2022, I was promoted at <a href="https://www.met.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span>Met Éireann</span> </a> to the role of Machine Learning Meteorologist. My work involves using Machine Learning techniques to predict fog formation at Irish airports, along with leading machine learning research developments at Met Éireann.
