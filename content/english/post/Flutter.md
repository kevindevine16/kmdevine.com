After almost 2 wonderful years working in Met Ã‰ireann, I decided to move to a new role as Quantitative Analyst at <a href="https://www.flutter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span>Flutter UKI</span> </a>. 

I am incredibly excited to begin this new opportunity, using mathematics to model and forecast sports for Flutter's UK and Ireland brands.
