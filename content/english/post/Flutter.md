I am delighted to share that I am starting a new role as Quantitative Analyst at <a href="https://www.flutter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span>Flutter UKI</span> </a>. 

After almost 2 years working at Met Ã‰ireann, I decided it was time for a change. During my time working in meteorology, I learned so much and met so many fantastic people, dedicated to public service. 

I am incredibly excited to begin this new opportunity, using mathematics to model and forecast sports for Flutter's UK and Ireland brands.
