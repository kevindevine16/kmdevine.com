In 2020, I begun a postdoctoral research role in MACSI, Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of LimerickL, researching nanowire technology in lithium ion battery anodes as part of the <a href="https://sidrive2020.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <span>Si-Drive</span> </a> consortium.

## Si-Drive

This work was done in collaboration with the international consortium Si-Drive, working with stakeholders such as FIAT and SMIT Thermal. My research involved coupling nonlinear elastic deformation theory with a diffusion model. The result was a highly nonlinear model for charging a copper-silicide hosted silicon nanowire. Due to the highly non-linear nature of the model, COMSOL Multiphysics, a commercial finite element solver, was used.

A journal publication is expected in Q1-Q2 2022.
